              Most popular apps on the App Store contain <a href="https://privacyreview.co" target=_blank>hidden
                trackers</a> that secretly send your information to marketing
              companies, data brokers, ad companies - basically anyone who will pay them. Normal Content Blockers and
              ad-blockers don't stop this tracking because they only work in Safari, or in specific browsers. That's why
              we
              created Lockdown, which blocks tracking, ads, and badware in <strong>all apps</strong>. Today, over
              100,000 people have
              used
              Lockdown to block over a billion tracking attempts.

              This means that anyone can see exactly what it's doing, and more
              importantly what it's *not* doing. All the major security and privacy products (even "name brand" security
              products, and especially products that you see a bunch of ads for) are closed source, which means what
              they're doing is totally secret. As a result, they're able to secretly sell your data to the highest
              bidder.
              With closed source products, you could end up paying for a security product that annihilates your privacy,
              and there's no way for them to prove otherwise. A few examples:

              Have you ever seen an ad for a "name brand" privacy product or app? Isn't it ironic that so-called
              "privacy"
              products are spending big bucks on invasive tracking/ad networks that they're supposed to be
              protecting users from? What does this say about their true values?
              <br /><br />
              Lockdown does not buy Facebook ads, or tracking ads of any kind, because we understand that that's the
              privacy-invading system we're trying to dismantle. We rely mostly on word of mouth, the quality of our
              product, and unsponsored journalism to spread our product to users. Note that for many so-called product
              "reviews" out there (even for well-known places like PC Magazine), they're actually using sponsored links
              in
              order to make money off of their reviews - distorting their incentive to tell the truth. Lockdown never
              does
              this.

              <a href="https://openlyoperated.org" target=_blank>Openly Operated</a> is the highest level of
              transparency for a product: everything from company ownership and location, to full third party
              audits, to proving its Privacy Policy.
              <br /><br />
              We created the Openly Operated transparency
              standard because we saw that companies were basically outright lying in their Privacy Policies. Of course,
              many companies are closed source or headquartered offshore, so they're usually not caught. However, even
              with companies that were actually caught, there would rarely be any kind of penalties. Openly Operated is
              a
              way to force companies to provide *proof* of their transparency, rather than just asserting them. You can
              read about why we launched Openly Operated <a href="https://openlyoperated.org/"
