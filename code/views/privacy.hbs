      <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;" class="mt-5">Non-Legalese Version: Everything Lockdown does stays on your phone, so no data is transmitted to any of our servers. This can be confirmed by checking our source code, which is 100% open and public for anyone to examine. Lockdown doesn't use any type of third party analytics, trackers, or APIs, so there's no risk of your data leaking to third parties. This means there's no Google Analytics, no Facebook Pixel, no Mixpanel, Fabric, Mailchimp, etc &mdash; nada.</p>
      <p class="pt-3 mt-5">Confirmed, Inc. (also “Confirmed”, “the company”, “we”, and “us”) collects the minimum data possible to ensure your data and privacy is protected.</p>
      <p>Confirmed complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for all users, regardless of location. In addition, we collect the minimum personal information required to provide the Lockdown service.</p>
      <p>We do not sell or provide data to advertising services, and there are zero third party frameworks for marketing or re-marketing purposes. This includes any direct or indirect advertising frameworks by Facebook, Twitter, and Google, including Crashlytics, Fabric, Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, Firebase, and Twitter SDK.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>Nothing. It all stays on your device.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Privacy Practices</h3>
      <p>We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>However, Confirmed understands that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries.</p>
      <p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Policy — to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:terms@{{DOMAIN}}" target="_blank">team@{{DOMAIN}}</a> and we will respond as quickly as we can.</p>
