                      Lockdown used to block ads in a popular app I use, what gives?

                      <p>
                          We do try hard to block ads in popular apps, but marketing and ad companies are always changing hosting and serving of
                          their ads to avoid ad blockers. It is sometimes the case that attempting ad blocking actually ends up blocking
                          the content that Lockdown users actually want to see in their apps, so it is a balancing act. We haven't given up though -
                          it's a work in progress and we are constantly working to improve our blocking. If you have any specific sites or apps
                          in mind, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@lockdownprivacy.com">team@lockdownprivacy.com</a><br />

                          This is usually caused by either an issue with the device settings, or some conflicting app/software. Here's what
                          to do:
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                              Ensure that Background App Refresh is enabled in Settings for Lockdown. Lockdown needs this in order to
                              refresh itself and stay active. See how to turn this on in Apple's documentation here: <a
                                  href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202070">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202070</a>.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Ensure that Low Battery Mode is set to off. Sometimes iPhones and iPads become overly aggressive in
                              stopping background apps like Lockdown when this mode is enabled. See how to get to this setting in
                              Apple's documentation here: <a
                                  href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234</a>.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Ensure that no other security products or VPNs are interfering with Lockdown. Lockdown is incompatible
                              with many third-party VPNs and/or security products. Here's how to turn those other conflicting apps off:
                              <ol>
                                  <li>Open Settings app</li>
                                  <li>Tap VPN</li>
                                  <li>If there are any entries that are NOT "Lockdown VPN" or "Lockdown Configuration", tap the "i" next
                                      it</li>
                                  <li>Turn "Connect On Demand" OFF for those entries (again, entries that are NOT Lockdown)</li>
                                  <li>Open Lockdown again, and activate Firewall and Secure Tunnel</li>
                              </ol>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Ensure that cellular data is turned <strong>ON</strong> for Lockdown. If you disable cellular data for
                              Lockdown, it will be unable to process legitimate app requests and apps will appear to have no internet
                              connection, despite your device having a strong cellular connection. Learn more about cellular data and Lockdown in this

                              and then update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the latest version available:

                      <p>
                          We've performed numerous benchmarks in controlled settings to ensure that Lockdown does not impact a
                          device's battery life. In some cases, Lockdown saves battery, because some apps spend so much energy
                          contacting advertisement and tracking servers. Unfortunately, due to misinformation and issues with iOS, we
                          sometimes get blamed for battery issues, so we'll explain how it all works here:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                              <strong>iOS miscalculates Lockdown's battery usage</strong> - Since Lockdown is always running in the
                              background to block requests, iOS thinks that apps (and app trackers) that Lockdown blocks are also part of Lockdown's
                              battery usage. This is not accurate, and we have submitted a bug report to Apple for them to fix this.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>iOS updates cause battery drain</strong> - Apple has released a few different updates for iOS
                              recently. Every time your iOS is updated (even a minor update), it does what is called a "re-index", which
                              means it optimizes all your content for faster searching. This can cause high battery usage and last several
                              days, and things return to normal a few days after the update. We do usually experience poor battery the first
                              few days of a new iOS version, such as with the recent update to iOS 15.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>New iOS versions have battery bugs</strong> - Apple often plays it "fast and loose" with major iOS
                              updates (like iOS 14 to iOS 15) because they need to coincide with hardware releases, so the early versions
                              of these major updates sometimes have battery-draining bugs.
                          </li>

                     aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4">
                      Why does iOS show that Lockdown is using cellular data?

                      <p>
                          The cellular data that is attributed to Lockdown is actually all your normal internet traffic. Lockdown's
                          Firewall filters the traffic on your device, so that it can block the ads/malware/badware. This means all
                          of your internet traffic goes through the Lockdown Firewall on your device (not to servers). This is why
                          your iPhone reports this as data usage by Lockdown - because it's filtering everything first before it
                          reaches the internet. If you turned off Lockdown you'll see data usage increase in the other apps you
                          use, because it would no longer be going through Lockdown's Firewall filter.

                      Why does the App Privacy Report show Lockdown connecting to so many domains?

                      <p>
                          In the "App Network Activity" section of the App Privacy Report (as of iOS/iPadOS 15.2):
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/appreport1.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      You will see a large number of domains that are attributed to Lockdown. These domains, like "gateway.icloud.com" (shown below):
                      are actually attempted connections (by apps or websites) that Lockdown has blocked. <br><br>
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/appreport2.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      When you enable Lockdown's Firewall, all of an app's traffic goes through the Firewall on your device.
                      This is why you see a domain being contacted by Lockdown - because all of that traffic goes through Lockdown
                      first, before it reaches the internet. If you turn off Lockdown's Firewall, or whitelist a domain, you'll
                      see those domains contacted by the apps themselves, as that traffic is no longer going through
                      Lockdown's Firewall.

                      <p>
                          1. Open Lockdown and click on "Block List" under Firewall:
                      <p></p>
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/customblock1.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      <p></p>
                      2. Click on "Custom" to add a new domain to the Block List:
                      <p></p>
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/customblock2.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      <p></p>
                      3. Type in the custom domain, and hit "done" on your keyboard:
                      <p></p>
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/customblock3.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      <p></p>
                      4. You should now see your custom domain in the list:
                      <p></p>
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/customblock4.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      <p></p>
                      5. Click "Save" in the top right corner of your screen to update the list:
                      <p></p>
                      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{S3_BUCKET}}/images/customblock5.png" style="border: 3px solid #555; width:100%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px;"></p>
                      <p></p>
                      6. Wait for the Firewall to restart, and now the new domain you've just added is being blocked!

                          In Apple's Mail app, in both iOS 15+ and macOS 12+, there is a new feature called "Mail Privacy Protection". It appears that this feature
                          conflicts with Lockdown's privacy protections, and we've reported this bug to Apple. Until there is a fix available, you can simply disable
                          this redundant feature - as Lockdown Firewall already blocks trackers, and Lockdown VPN hides your IP address. Here's how to do that:

                          <li>
                              Open the Settings app.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Tap "Mail".
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Tap "Privacy Protection".

                          Facebook tries very hard to ensure that you are in their tracking system whether you are using Facebook, Facebook Messenger,
                          Instagram, WhatsApp or any other apps they own - as well as other apps that use their login or ad networks. Lockdown
                          blocks these tracking attempts. Here's how to fix issues that you might see with Facebook's apps, or any other
                          apps that use Facebook login or other features:
                          <br />
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                              Open Lockdown, and under Firewall, tap on "Block List".
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Try setting both "Facebook & WhatsApp" and "Facebook Trackers" to "not blocked" in the Block List. Be sure
                              to tap "SAVE" at the top right, and let the Firewall re-activate before trying again.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Try to log into the app with Facebook. Once you're logged into the app, you should be able to set 'Facebook Trackers'
                              to "blocked" again. You might need to keep "Facebook & WhatsApp" set to "not blocked", depending upon the app.
                          </li>
                      </ol>

                          <li>
                              Open Lockdown
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Tap "Whitelist"
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              On iOS, tap the "domain-to-whitelist.com" field. Or if you're on macOS, under "Custom Domains",
                              click the "New Domain" field.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Enter the domain associated with the app or website you'd like to whitelist. For example,
                              "yahoo.com" (without quotation marks) will whitelist the Yahoo website.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              On iOS, tap "Done", then "Save". On macOS, click "Add".
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Wait for the Firewall to re-activate (it will appear to turn off and back on again). If this doesn't happen, try it
                              again and ensure that you hit "Done" and "Save" (or "Add" on Mac).

                          Facebook's trackers are embedded in many (if not most) popular AppStore apps. This gives Facebook
                          information about who you are, and what you do in apps - so that Facebook can serve you advertisements
                          and other targeted content. So even if you don't have Facebook itself installed, their trackers still come
                          bundled with many popular apps. Lockdown blocks these tracking attempts.

                          The "Lockdown Configuration" on your Mac or iPhone/iPad is what creates the localhost "127.0.0.1" which allows
                          all of your app traffic to pass through Lockdown's block lists first. This is what enables the on-device
                          blocking. The IP address "127.0.0.1" is a special reserved address called localhost that is only accessible on your device
                          (iPhone, iPad, or Mac). "Lockdown VPN", also in network preferences (or VPN Settings), is the Secure Tunnel
                          and this is what enables access to our VPN service, which we call Secure Tunnel, in the Lockdown app.

                              that it took extra time (a day or two) for it to arrive in their inbox. If you're using a desktop email
                              client, be sure to check the spam box in your web interface too - sometimes users find that there is a
                              separate spam filter on the online interface.

                              As a last resort, try signing up again using a different email address. We are finding that for unknown reasons,
                              some email providers are blocking our emails completely. There's nothing we can really do in that case. To
                              do this, open Lockdown, tap Account on the bottom right. Then tap "Sign Out" (at the top), then tap "Sign

                              On that same device, make sure you're logged into Lockdown with your email, by tapping the "Account" tab
                              at the bottom. The screen should say "Signed In As [Your Email Address]". If it does not say that, then tap
                              "Sign Up" to sign up and confirm your email address.

                              On that same device, enable Secure Tunnel.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              On your family member's device, tap into the "Account" tab, then "Sign In". Sign in using the same
                              Lockdown account (email and password) from step 2.
                          </li>

                              On your family member's device, tap into the "Protect" tab, and activate Secure Tunnel. It should now
                              work!

                          Confirmed VPN powers the Secure Tunnel VPN in Lockdown. It's the VPN service we built before we created
                          Lockdown, and was also crucial for us to create the Openly Operated transparency certification. Lockdown provides
                          both the Firewall and Secure Tunnel features, and Confirmed VPN is only the Secure Tunnel product. We
                          recommend you use the Lockdown app to access both features.
