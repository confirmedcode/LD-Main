<p>Popular apps are often secretly sending personal data to marketing companies, or including invasive third-party trackers, or abusing permissions that they're granted, even in the background.</p>
<p>In our <strong>Privacy Reviews</strong> series, we dissect one app per review and tell you which third-party trackers it's using, what the trackers do, and what data they collect. We use the <a href="lockdownhq.com" target="_blank">Lockdown</a> app to automatically expose and block these behaviors.</p>

<p>For our first review, we chose the video chat app <strong>Houseparty</strong> due to its popularity, boosted by recent mandatory stay-at-home orders. Even though the app is free for its users, how much is the marketing data and tracking of 50+ million teens and young adults worth? We begin with a summary card, and delve into details below.

      Lockdown recorded and blocked <strong>214 tracking attempts</strong> to third-parties in our five minutes of using Houseparty. This included app installation, initial launch, signup, and a ten second videochat.</p>
      <p>The more actions that we took, the more third-party tracking was recorded - for example, opening settings and modifying something would create tracking attempts. Adding a friend would also create multiple tracking attempts, as would starting a video call. 
      </p>
      <p>
      We detected no background tracking (tracking that occurs when the app was not in use) in the one hour time span that we monitored Houseparty.
      </p>
      <p>
      Every time Houseparty was re-opened, Lockdown logged 36 more tracking attempts to at least three different third-party trackers.

      <strong>Houseparty gets a Privacy Grade of C+.</strong> While we can't certain exactly what Houseparty is sending to third parties, we know at the very least, every app activation and user action, along with unique identifiers are being sent for unknown processing. That totals to hundreds of data points per user (per day), multiplied by over 50 million users (and growing), multiplied by the number of different marketing and tracking companies involved.
      </p>
      <p>During our testing, we did not use Houseparty's "Connect To Facebook" feature. Had we done so, we would have likely logged Facebook Tracker blocking in addition to the other third parties above.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you have the <a href="https://lockdownhq.com">Lockdown</a> app installed, you're automatically protected against the trackers and privacy intrusions described above. This test was conducted using version 0.3.6, and with the "Marketing (Beta)" Block List set to "Blocked".
