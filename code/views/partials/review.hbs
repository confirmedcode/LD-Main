<p>Popular apps are often secretly sending personal data to marketing companies, or including invasive third-party trackers, or abusing permissions that they're granted, even in the background.</p>
<p>In our <strong>Privacy Reviews</strong> series, we dissect one app per review and tell you which third-party trackers it's using, what the trackers do, and what data they collect. We use the <a href="lockdownhq.com" target="_blank">Lockdown</a> app to automatically expose and block these behaviors.</p>

      Lockdown recorded and blocked <strong>214 tracking attempts</strong> in our five minutes of using Houseparty. This included app installation, initial launch, signup, and a ten second videochat.<br/><br/>Every time Houseparty was opened again, Lockdown logged 36 more tracking attempts. We detected no background tracking, but we only used the app for about an hour.<br/><br/>To ensure that these tracking attempts only came from Houseparty, we tested with an iPhone that was factory reset before the test, with no other apps installed.

      <strong>Houseparty gets a Privacy Grade of C+.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>While we can't be 100% sure of what exactly Houseparty is sending to third party marketing and analytics companies, at the very least, every app activation, user action, and unique identifiers are being sent for unknown processing. Note that we did not use Houseparty's "Connect To Facebook" feature. Had we done so, we would have likely tripped more of Lockdown's Facebook Tracker blocking.</p>
      <p>
      If you have the free <strong><a href="https://lockdownhq.com">Lockdown</a></strong> app installed, you are automatically protected against the trackers and privacy intrusions described above. This test was conducted using Lockdown v0.3.6, and with the "Marketing (Beta)" Block List set to "Blocked".
